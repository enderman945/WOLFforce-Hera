# WOLFforce Hera

WOLFforce Hera is a management tool for WOLFforce content. It provides updates for modpacks and can be used to download lastest versions of supported shaders or resource packs.
It uses WinUI 3 to match as well as possible the new Windows 11 design guidelines and Template Studio to accelerate the development of the app base.

This ptoject was archived due to a revamped version of the original idea but this time using electron, with more features, a better portability and enhanced design.
